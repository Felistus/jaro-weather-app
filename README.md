## Overview

![screenshot](/public/images/appScreenshot.PNG)

Introduce your projects by taking a screenshot or a gif. Try to tell visitors a story about your project by answering:

- Where can I see your demo?
  The demo for this project can be found using the **Demo** link above.

- What was your experience?
  Building this app was a awesome experience, sweet and at the same time bitter. Every bit of it was challenging ranging from the design implementation down to the functionality programming. I had to pay attention to every details outlined by the designer in-order not to misrepresent the design. Though I brought in some initiative to better improve the layout.

- What have you learned/improved?
  - API data and error handling
  - Better use of vercel SWR for fetching and caching of data for efficiency and low latency
  - Attention to details and time management
  - Using custom fonts in Next.js
  - Deployment on vercel and adding environmental variables for production

- Your wisdom? :)
  Keep practising, and perfection will have no option but to embrace you.
